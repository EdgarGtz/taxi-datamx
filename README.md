Most Mexican states have not made public their taxi register data.
Regardless I'll be uploading and cleaning each state's data as soon as 
they become available. 

You can find the same clean data files and links to their raw versions
at [Datamx](http://datamx.io/). Search for 'Padron de Taxis'.

### Data
